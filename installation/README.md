## Default: normal installation

## Advanced: using a virtual environment

If you want to install a library with Jupyter Notebook extensions in a virtual environment you need to perform some additional steps. We added the steps in the following tutorials:

- I want to install bamboolib inside a [virtualenv](./virtualenv/setup_and_installation.md#installing-bamboolib-using-virtualenv)
- I want to install bamboolib inside a [conda **virtual** environment](./conda_venv/setup_and_installation.md#installing-bamboolib-using-conda-environment)
